# E-school
 
This Project was my first python written code. The goal was to automate my online school, so I don't need to touch my keyboard at all and still attend in every meeting.

# How does it work?
I used the package "pyautogui", what let's me control my keyboard and mouse through script.

Every subject had its own link, what I can simply open with one line of code. In my script I made a timer and virtual schedule, so my pc knows when to open what. On the webpages I had to: 1. confirm my attendence 2. join the meeting. Now I just searched for a specific picture and clicked it, until both my steps are done.

One Problem is still left: I have to turn on my pc early in the morning manually. To this I made a simple solution with a smart plug and google home.
